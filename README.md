Medical Insurance Cost Prediction using Machine Learning
In this project, I developed a predictive model to estimate medical insurance costs based on various factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, was preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.

I implemented and compared three regression models—Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Random Forest Regression—to evaluate their effectiveness in predicting insurance costs. The models were trained and tested on a well-split dataset, and their performances were analyzed using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² Score.

To visually assess model accuracy, I plotted scatter plots and line graphs comparing the predicted values with actual insurance costs. The project also includes model saving for future deployment.

This project demonstrates the impact of different regression techniques on cost prediction and highlights the importance of feature preprocessing in machine learning.
